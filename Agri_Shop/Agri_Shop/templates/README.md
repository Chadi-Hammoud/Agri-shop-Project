# AgriShop WebApp

Hi, this is one of my personal project Web Apps, it's a website for selling agricultural produce and it's still in development, link: https://agrishop-fa8d4.web.app/index.html


## Motivation

It all started on the day I realised that I needed a new ideea for a website, and after a long search I decided to make an interactive webshop, combining coding with my other pasion, agriculture. The site ended up having ten different pages, and it's still in development. 

## Requirements

There are no specific requirments for running this app.

## Installation or Getting Started

No installment neded, the website it's just plain HRML CSS and JS and for runnig you need just to download the code on your machine, unzip it and run it on a browser of your choosing.

## Usage

When it will be ready the project will be used as a place for seeing, ordering and buying agricultural produces, I intent to have a backend part to it later for storing values in databases and a  user login system.



## Contributors

I am the only contributer on this project for now but I am open for new memebrs joining in and helping to make the project a great website.
